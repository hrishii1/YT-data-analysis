##YouTube Data Analysis Project üöÄ


This project is a comprehensive YouTube Data Analysis Pipeline built using AWS services. The goal is to ingest, process, store, and analyze YouTube data to derive insights, leveraging the scalability and reliability of AWS cloud infrastructure. Here's an overview of the key components:

Project Overview üéØ
Data Ingestion: Automate data ingestion from Kaggle (or other sources) into AWS S3 buckets.
ETL System: Transform raw data into a structured format using AWS Glue and AWS Lambda for creating reusable ETL scripts.
Data Lake: Centralized storage of raw, transformed, and query-ready data in S3 for multiple data sources.
Scalability: Ensure the system can handle growing data volumes using AWS services like Glue and S3, designed to scale seamlessly.
Cloud-Based: Process and analyze data in the cloud, leveraging AWS compute and storage resources for efficiency.
Reporting: Build dashboards using Amazon QuickSight to visualize data insights interactively.

Workflow ‚öôÔ∏è
Data Ingestion:

Data is sourced from Kaggle and uploaded to AWS S3.
Used AWS CLI, Boto3 scripts, or direct integrations for file uploads.
Data Transformation (ETL):

AWS Glue crawlers discover raw data schema.
AWS Lambda functions and Glue jobs process and clean the data.
Transform data into formats like Parquet for faster querying.
Data Lake:

Centralized data storage in Amazon S3 ensures all raw and processed data is accessible in a unified repository.
Data is partitioned for efficient querying and storage.
Data Analysis:

Use Amazon Athena to run SQL queries directly on S3 data.
Answer critical business questions (e.g., trending topics, most popular channels) using SQL queries.
Data Visualization:

Create interactive dashboards with Amazon QuickSight.
Enable stakeholders to explore data insights visually.
Features ‚ú®
End-to-End Pipeline: Automates ingestion, processing, and visualization.
Scalable: Easily handles large datasets and growing data volumes.
Cloud-Native: Utilizes AWS cloud services for storage and computation.
Interactive Dashboards: Gain actionable insights with QuickSight.
Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è
AWS account with necessary permissions for S3, Glue, Lambda, Athena, and QuickSight.
